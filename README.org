This package is bran new (as of September 19, 2024). Use with caution.

Emacs Org mode provides a nice feature which is that you can archive a subheading to an archive file or heading. However, by default, the archived sub-trees are all inserted at the root level of the archive folder.

This package provides the ability to archive a tree in org mode such that the branch structure of the org file is mirrored by the archive file, without creating duplicate branches or clobbering existing branches.
* Installation
Clone the repository in your preferred destination.
#+begin_src sh
  cd ~/path/to
  git clone https://github.com/Duncan-Britt/emacs-archiver.git
#+end_src

Add the following to your config, specifying the path to the cloned repository and the path to your agenda archive file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package archiver
    :load-path "~/path/to/archiver/"
    :after org
    :init
    (setq *archiver-agenda-archive-location*
          (expand-file-name "~/path/to/your/agenda_archive.org"))
    :bind
    (:map org-mode-map
          ("C-c C-x C-a" . archiver-archive-heading)))
#+end_src
* Known Issues
This package make the simplifying assumption that the immediate child headings will be distinct under the parent heading. That is, no duplicates. For the author's use case, it's a reasonable assumption, and handling the case where it's not true would take a lot of effort.
